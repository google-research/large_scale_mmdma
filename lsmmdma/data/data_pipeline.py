  """Generates two views following the `simulation` shape in their latent space.

  The simulation process follows the one given in the original MMD-MA paper (Liu
  et al. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34632462/). A manifold (of shape
  'branch' or 'triangle') is generated in two dimensions. The resulting set of
  points is standardised. The points are then mapped to `p_feature` dimensions
  using a (2 x p_feature) mapping, sampled from a standard Gaussian distribution,
  resulting in a (n_sample * p_feature) matrix. Gaussian noise is then added to
  each element of the matrix.

  In these simulations, we assume that the numbers of samples and features are
  are the same for both domains.

  Arguments:
    path: path to output directory where to save the generated data.
    n_sample: number of samples.
    p_feature: number of features.
    random_seed: seed for random (random_seed) and numpy (random_seed + 1)
    simulation: str, latent structure for the input data. The latent structure
      can either be a 'branch' (two elongated Gaussian point clouds
      perpendicular to each other) or a 'triangle' (three elongated Gaussian
      point clouds forming a triangle).

  Returns:
    tuple, first view, second view and corresponding indices from the first
      view.
